            <b>What is Bootleg?</b><br>
            It’s a website. You buy things. We send them. That’s the whole magic. I don't know what else to tell you.
            <br><br>
            <b>How long does shipping take?</b><br>
            Somewhere between “soon” and “eventually.”. We say 3–10 business days, but life is unpredictable.
            I once ordered a toaster and it showed up 6 months later. Not from us, but still.
            <br><br>
            <b>Can I return something?</b><br>
            Yeah. You can. Within 30 days. Don’t use it, don’t break it, don’t send it back covered in regret.
            Print a label, toss it in a box, hope someone at the warehouse isn’t on their break.
            <br><br>
            <b>Where’s my tracking info?</b><br>
            You should get an email. If not, check spam. If it’s not there, I don’t know—maybe it got lost in the void.
            That happens. A lot. Tough luck.
            <br><br>
            <b>What payments do you take?</b><br>
            Whatever works. Credit card, debit, probably PayPal. No crypto.
            <br><br>
            <b>My item is broken.</b><br>
            So is my will to live. But yeah, email us a photo. We’ll try to sort it out. It helps only if you don’t scream in all caps.
            <br><br>
            <b>Who do I contact?</b><br>
            roadrollb@gmail.com<br>
            We read emails Monday through Friday. Unless the Wi-Fi goes down again.
            We respond in 1–2 business days. Maybe. Depends if someone shows up.
            <br><br>
            <b>Is there a store I can visit?</b><br>
            No. Just this site.
            You’re already in the store. This is it. Hope you're enjoying the ambiance.
            <br><br>
            <b>Why “Bootleg”?</b><br>
            Someone thought it was cool in a meeting 12 days ago.
            No one stopped them. Here we are.
            <br><br>
            <b>Are the products legit?</b><br>
            Look. They work. They do the thing they’re supposed to do.
            Is that not enough anymore?
