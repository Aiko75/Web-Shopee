            <b> Terms of Service </b><br>
            Last updated: 21/4/2025
            <br><br>
            Welcome. These Terms of Service govern your use of Bootleg. By using this service, you agree to these Terms. If you don't agree, then, well... don’t use it.
            <br><br>
            <b> 1. Using the Service </b><br>
            You can use this service as long as you do not do anything illegal, disruptive, or weird. Just be normal, please.
            <br><br>
            <b> 2. Changes to the Service or Terms </b><br>
            We might update the service or these Terms whenever we feel it is necessary (or when someone upstairs tells us to). We’re not obligated to notify you, so maybe check back sometimes, or don’t — that’s on you.
            <br><br>
            <b> 3. Accounts </b><br>
            If this service requires an account, do not share your password, do not pretend to be someone else, and do not blame us if you get hacked because you used “password123.”
            <br><br>
            <b> 4. Privacy </b><br>
            We probably collect data. Everyone does. Check the Privacy Policy if you’re really curious — it’s got more words than this.
            <br><br>
            <b> 5. Disclaimer </b><br>
            This service is provided “as is.” No guarantees, no promises, no magic. Use it if you want, but don’t come crying to us if something breaks.
            <br><br>
            <b> 6. Termination </b><br>
            We can ban or suspend your account at any time, with or without a reason. It probably won't happen, but it could.
            <br><br>
            <b> 7. Legal Stuff </b><br>
            If something goes wrong and lawyers get involved, that’s between you and the jurisdiction listed somewhere deep in the fine print.
